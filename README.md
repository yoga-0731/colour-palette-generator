# Image color palette generator
A fun and useful Python Flask application where we could upload an image and know the colour palette of that image.

## Functionality
  - Upload any image.
  - Using colorgram module, the colors are extracted. If colorgram is unable to extract the color, the closest color to the former is chosen. And all these are converted to hex code.
  - Image and all colors from the image are displayed.
